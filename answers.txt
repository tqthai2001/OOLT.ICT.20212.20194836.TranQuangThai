1. If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
- It's error. Because Java does not allow to compare two objects which are different data types.

2. Which method(s) do you need to implement from this interface?
- public int compareTo (Object o)

3. Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using toString() method.
Observe what happens and explain it in detail.

- Method toString() has been overriden in Book, DVD, CD Class. Therefore, when print out it return string that I defined
in each class.
