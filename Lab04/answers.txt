Q1. Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd.
Compared to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?

- I prefer the method which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. It is called Varargs method. This varargs
method is convenient than passing array parameter because we do not have to create an array in the main function. The method
creates an array of unspecified length in the background.

Q2. Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?

- Java is a PASS BY VALUE programming language

- Because modifying the reference to an object can change the real arguments of the object
